Duncan Jones is the only child from the marriage of musician David Bowie (born David Robert Jones) and his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, an American former model. He was born at Bromley Hospital[1] in Kent. His birth prompted Bowie to write the song "Kooks" for his 1971 album Hunky Dory.[2] Jones is the half-brother of Alexandria "Lexi" Jones (born 2000), from his father's second marriage to the fashion model Iman, and Jones is the half-brother of Stacia Larranna Celeste Lipka (born 1980), from his mother's relationship with musician Drew Blood (real name Andrew Lipka). He also has a stepsister, Zulekha Haywood (born 1978), who is the daughter of Iman and former NBA basketball player Spencer Haywood, Iman's second husband.
